    "Kelly led Bud and I through some soldering training.  Practiced soldering first just wires, and then wires to solder cups as will apply to our connectors.  Practiced with large wires and then thin wires as we will be using both.  Then in addition Bud recived bottle training which served as a review for me as well.  We are out of helium and will need to order more to power the compressor as discussed below."

    "Spent the vast majority of time this week cleaning the parts of the disassembled cryostat.  Also on Friday, the visiting high school student helped with this cleaning using both the ultrasonic, as well as rubbing down with ethanol.  All of the parts are cleaned and stored in the dust-free room now, with the exception of the main exterior body of the cryostat chamber.  Kelly mentioned being able to put these in the big ultrasonic.  If not they can be cleaned with just ethanol.\n",

I then guest swiped him into sage dining hall for lunch, and then he worked with me and Bud until I had to leave and then with just Bud until 5 PM."

    "The Compressor He Fill line is a 15 mm NPT connection which we have acess to in the lab and can then power with the new helium that comes in.  The powering instructions are in the manual recived from Janis Engineering.  There seems to be some helium still in the compressor, as the pressure is at ~70 psi.  In addition the McMaster order placed (differ to Bud), should contain the necessary connections for the waterlines.  Need to check pressure requiremnt of powering the compressor to see if we need to use a metal tube or not.  "
