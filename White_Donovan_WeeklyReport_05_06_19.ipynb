The RGA measurement depicted here has yet to bottom out at a final pressure but after fixing the leak it was below the necessary vacuum presuures for the coldhead system ($1 \\cdot 10^{-3} torr$) and the partial pressure of water vapor ($1 \\cdot 10^{-5} torr$)."

    "The Compressor was filled with helium using the new copper tubing flanging tool and filled to 255 psi per the LTS-22 Manual.  Then the helium supply and return self coupling lines were connected to the compressor and run through the alcolve to the main room and attached to the coldhead.  The pressure in the compressor dropped significantly from order 250 psi to 150 psi after attaching the helium lines.  This based on the manual descriptions and procedure seems to be an inherant step of powering the coldhead."

    "Unfortunately a cool down test was not able to be performed.  The manual explicitly say that a cooldown test shown not be attempted if the sensor is not properly callibrated.  At room temperature the silicon diode was reading a temperature of 428 K or 155 C which is far from the desired readout of 298 K or 25 C.  This could be a result of the sensor being currently setup with a calibration curve for low temperature and hence the reading is off, but the only way to check that seems to be to cooldown the system which it is said not to do without the sensor already being propoerly calibrated.  Further inquisition into the prior calibration of this system or a way to test that is necessary in order to perform said cooldown test."
